Welcome to my Maynooth Boxing club website. The Maynooth boxing  website is aimed at getting people from the local commnuity of Maynooth and also neighbouring towns to get involved in Boxing while also getting fit. The site was created in order to give the boxing club owners a way of informing people on what classes are provided and also at what time they are on at while also giving users an option to contact them on

FEATURES:

The website contains a fully functioning navigation bar and also a separate page that has a contact form people to submit any queries to the club owners.

Upon opening the website you see a clear header indicating what the website is and also a landing image that indicates this further.

Below the landing image you have an about us section. This gives the users an indication of who the people are that run the boxing club and what qualifications they also have.

Once you get by the about us section you come to the classes section. This gives the users the details of what classses are provided and at what time they are on. This allows the users know if times suit and also allows them choose what classes they would consider doing.

Finally on the main page you have at the footer the social media links which when clicked bring you firectly to the boxing clubs social media pages.

Once the users have scrolled through they can then go to the contact us page to fill out a form to directly contact the the club filling in a few details that allows the club understand why they are contacting them while also giving detailsto contact the users back on.

TESTING:

I have teseted the nav bar numerous times and all links work and alo teseted the form which can be submitted and also requires a certain amount of info and will correct the user if it is not entered.

HTML passed the W3C validoator with no erros but there was errors initally that needed to be corrected. Formatting the file on Codeanywhere gave the hr tags a /to close the tag and these needed to be removed.

CSS also passed the jigsaw validator. First check there was a parse error but once corrected no erros were found.

UNFIXED BUGS:

One thing i struggled with was the form. Although you can submit the form ti does not say all the fields were submitted even though all fields are filled out. I have attemoted to correct this but without plagiarising i just could not get the code right.

Update to the above. I was able to fix the form bug.

DEPLOYMENT:
The site was deployed to GITHUB pages.
In the GitHub repository, I navigateg to the Settings tab
From the source section drop-down menu,I  selected the Master Branch
Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
