      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <h3>
        <em>
          Founded in 2019 Maynooth Boxing club was started by John Donovan and
          his wife Marlene. Both John and Marlene have competed at amateur level
          and both represented Ireland at numerous world Championships. John and
          Marlene are both from Maynooth. When they began boxing training they
          had to travel to Dublin city as there were no local boxing clubs close
          by. Since both have retired from competitive boxing their goal has
          been to setup a local boxing club in Maynooth. This became a reality
          in 2018 and since then they opened a fully equipped boxing gym that
          provides classes for all ages and all skill levels. Whether your goal
          is to just get fit or learn the beautiful science of boxing this is
          the gym that will cater for you.They gym operates on a pay as you go
          system so there is no commitment at all required ad prices range
          depending on the classes that you attend. The first class for everyone
          is free. So come on down or get in touch using our contact form and
          we will get back to you.
